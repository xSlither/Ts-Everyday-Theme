An extension for VS Code that comes with 2 new themes that use specific syntax highlighting for TypeScript, that I have found useful.

The themes are:

* TS Everyday - A dark-purple theme with the custom TypeScript syntax highlighting
* TS Everyday Lite - A classic Dark+ based theme with the same syntax highlighting as TS Everyday

**Enjoy!**
